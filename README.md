# ascii-patrol
Ascii Patrol is an ASCII game project. It was mainly inspired by "Moon Patrol", my favourite arcade game at the times I was a child.

Currently game can be built for 
- Windows (VC2010)
- Linux & Cygwin (GCC)
- DOS (Watcom) 
- HTML5 browsers (Emscripten)

To use / modify / add graphics asserts located in 'asset' directory you need to use [REXPaint](http://gridsagegames.com/rexpaint)
Copy 'assets' directory to REXPaint's 'images' subdirectory. To apply modifications to the game, in next step you should use
temp_xp program which converts all .xp files located in some directory to assets.cpp and assets.h files being compiled with game.

AP can be easily built and runs great on Raspberry PI!
